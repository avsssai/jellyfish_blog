					&quot;Why do you <span className='text-bgRed font-black text-2xl'> like jellyfish</span> so
					much?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I don&apos;t know. I guess I think they&apos;re cute,&rdquo; she said.
					&ldquo;But one thing did occur to me when I was really focused on them. What we see before us is
					just one tiny part of the world. We get into the habit of thinking, This is the world, but
					that&apos;s not true at all. The real world is in a much darker and deeper place than this, and most
					of it is occupied by <span className='text-bgRed font-black'> jellyfish and things</span>. We just
					happen to forget all that. Don&apos;t you agree? Two thirds of the earth&apos;s surface is ocean,
					and all we can see of it with the naked eye is the surface: the skin. We hardly know anything about
					what&apos;s beneath the skin.‚Äù
